                <p><em>The Left Point</em> is an attempt to make the audience realize the extent to which their understanding of news events can be manipulated. Through extreme censorship, the artist deliberately removes any possibility of accurate interpretation by suppressing the very opinions and discussions she set out to expose.<em><br>How can you know that what you are watching is true, when most of it has been removed to fit on your phone?</em><br>This video-episode is the first of a series of works where entertainment, fake news and clickbait tactics are put to the test. The initial performances and footage of this first episode were produced in post Brexit-referendum Belfast, Northern Ireland in November 2016 in the midst of Donald Trumps final ascendancy to presidency. The artist asked 10 inviduals who identify as progressives to sit down and disagree with one another. </p>

                <p>Mich and Marshall are asked to share a personal story in front of a camera. Both participants come to experience a unified understanding of events when one’s story is orally taken on by the other. This continuous one-shot 15-minute documentary performance demonstrates our empathetic capacity as individuals. This piece was made in response to recent scientific findings that demonstrate that a 10-minute active one-on-one conversation between two individuals can durably reduce longstanding ingrained prejudice.¹ <br> These findings inspired this performance for video in addition to bringing an empirical premise to the artist’s constant use of human interaction as a conceptual and political device.</p>

                    <p class=paragraphs>CHRONIQUE D'UN ÉTÉ // single channel | colour + sound | 09:58 minutes | 2016 <br>has been selected for GSTAADFILM 2018 Art Film Festival in Montevideo, Uruguay.<br>The work is being translated in Spanish! Festival is on November 16-17-18, 2017.<br> <br> <em> This work borrows its title from famous French documentary classic CHRONIQUE D'UN ÉTÉ (directed by Edouard Morin and Jean Rouch, 1961). In a similar way to its predecessor, this contemporary Québécois take on cinema vérité also presents a youth particular to its time, place and economic status. CHRONIQUE D'UN ÉTÉ (directed by Veronica Mockler, 2016) documents the conversation of three young privileged white individuals belonging to a typical Western world demographic. The issues raised by this somewhat captivating group of friends constitute the artist’s critique. The futility of their interaction, though entertaining at first, slowly becomes alarming for anyone viewing the work. How these young people have the luxury to be solely concerned with their hair color is the reality the works aims to expose and subvert.</em>  </p>

                <p> Veronica Mockler (Canadian, b. 1991) is a visual artist working and living in Montréal, (Québec). Her practice stands at the crossroads of video art, documentary, performance and advocacy. She graduated from Concordia University in 2014 (Bachelor of Fine Arts with Distinction, Prog. Studio Arts, Dep. Intermedia Cyberarts). Her work has been featured locally and internationally in both solo and group exhibitions / screenings (Redding Flagg Gallery, Toronto, Dazibao, Eastern Bloc, Montréal, Manif. d’Art Biennale de Québec, Gstaad International Short Art Film Festival, Uruguay, and more.) Her video work is distributed by Vidéographe Montreal. Veronica has conducted research both in Canada and abroad (Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Iceland), has worked as a curator (Active Lens, Montréal) and as a facilitator for arts outreach (Action Refugié Montréal, Dazibao, Leonard and Bina Ellen Gallery) in addition to receiving private (Ann Duncan Award, CUSRA Award, and more.) and public funding (City of Montreal, MEESR Bursary, LOJIQ Grant, and more.) for her work and research.<br> <br>My work is about the radical experience of the other. Through case-studies, videos, performances and interviews, I work with individuals to create situations in which their representation challenges the audience's social status quo. I am driven by the idea that encountering the other enables one’s consideration of the other, something I believe is not only crucial right now, but can be conducive of progressive thought and action. I hold my contemporary art production socially accountable therefore dedicate my practice to finding new ways to represent and engage the political self. I benefit from the societal advantages of being white and cis. In order to not extend this bias, I deconstruct my own privilege by making work that serves the reality and power of individuals, not mine.</font> </span>
